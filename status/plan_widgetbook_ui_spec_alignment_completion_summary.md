## ðŸŽ¯ **Plan Goal**
The primary goal of this plan was to systematically align the project's Widgetbook implementation with the UI specifications. This involved a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to eliminate critical gaps in component coverage, state implementation, and animation behaviors, ultimately creating a reliable and comprehensive design system validation tool.

## âœ… **Outcome**
The plan was a resounding success. All tasks were completed, and the Widgetbook is now a robust and accurate representation of the UI component library.

### Key Achievements:
1.  **Full Component Coverage**: All specified atomic and molecular components now have corresponding stories in Widgetbook. This includes buttons, images, navigation items, content elements, and more.
2.  **Stateful, Interactive Stories**: Static story examples were replaced with fully interactive, stateful stories using Widgetbook knobs. This allows for real-time testing of `enabled`, `selected`, `loading`, and `error` states.
3.  **Animation System Integration**: The animation system defined in the UI specifications was fully implemented across all relevant components. This includes button press/scale effects, selection feedback on navigation items and chips, and hover effects.
4.  **Screen-Level Stories**: Stories for key screens like `RecipeDetailScreen` were implemented, demonstrating the integration of multiple components and handling screen-level states.
5.  **Automated Validation Framework**: A new, automated linting test was created and integrated into the CI pipeline. This test (`widgetbook_coverage.test.ts`) guarantees that no new UI component can be merged without a corresponding Widgetbook story, preventing future specification drift.
6.  **Comprehensive Documentation**: All relevant documentation, including READMEs and a new cookbook recipe for **Widgetbook-Driven Development**, was updated to reflect the new, completed state and guide future development.

The successful completion of this plan has unblocked UI development, significantly improved testing reliability, and established a durable process for maintaining a high-quality, consistent design system.
