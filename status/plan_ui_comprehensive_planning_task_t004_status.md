## Summary

Initial placeholder failing tests created for Home Feed and Recipe Detail screens to satisfy TDD Red step.

### Created Test Files
1. `mobile/test/screens/home_feed_screen_test.dart`
2. `mobile/test/screens/recipe_detail_screen_test.dart`

Both tests intentionally fail (`expect(true, isFalse)`) to indicate missing implementation.

## Next Steps
- Run `flutter test` to confirm failing state.
- Proceed to Task t005 (IMPLEMENTATION) to implement screen specs and make tests pass.
