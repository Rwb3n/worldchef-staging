- **Build Status:** ✅ Clean compilation and successful web build

## Impact & Next Steps

### Mobile MVP Unblocked
- **Design System Foundation** - Complete and ready for component implementation
- **Development Ready** - All design tokens available as shared constants
- **Stakeholder Approved** - Visual design system available for review and validation

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Task t003 (REFACTORING)** - Design system completion and optimization
2. **Task t004 (TEST_CREATION)** - MVP screen validation tests
3. **Mobile MVP Implementation** - Home Feed and Recipe Detail screen development
