# Status Report: Design System Specification - Create MVP-critical design system foundation

**Plan**: `plans/plan_ui_comprehensive_planning.txt`  
**Task**: `t002`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Global Event**: 138

## üéØ **Objective**

Create a MINIMUM VIABLE design system foundation with essential design tokens for MVP start, making the failing validation tests from `t001` pass (Green).

## ‚úÖ **Completion Summary**

The MVP design system foundation has been **fully implemented and validated against the `design_tokens.md` specification**. All "Red" Widgetbook stories from `t001` are now "Green", demonstrating a compliant and functional design system. This task is complete and unblocks the Mobile MVP workstream.

### Key Achievements:
- **Specification Compliance**: The implementation is in 100% compliance with `docs/ui_specifications/design_system/design_tokens.md`.
- **Core Tokens Implemented**: All specified colors, typography, spacing, dimensions, and animation tokens are now available as shared constants.
- **Theme Assembled**: `AppTheme` now provides `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` `ThemeData` objects that correctly assemble all the design tokens for use in the app.
- **Dark Theme Support**: A detailed, specification-compliant dark theme has been implemented alongside the light theme.
- **Widgetbook "Green"**: All placeholder stories have been replaced with live demonstrations of the design system. The Widgetbook is now a reliable visual source of truth.
- **Dependencies Met**: The `google_fonts` dependency has been added and successfully fetched.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Corrective Actions Taken**

An initial implementation was found to be non-compliant with the detailed `design_tokens.md` specification. A full refactoring was performed to address the following discrepancies:
- **Colors**: Replaced generic `ColorScheme.fromSeed()` with a precise `ColorScheme` built from `WorldChefColors` and `WorldChefDarkTheme` classes.
- **Typography**: Replaced default Material 3 type scale with a custom `TextTheme` using the specified `Lora` and `Nunito` fonts and styles.
- **Spacing & Dimensions**: Added all missing tokens and layout helper classes (`WorldChefLayout`).
- **Animations**: Corrected all durations and added the `AnimationConfig` helper class.

**This validation and correction cycle ensures the final implementation is robust and fully aligned with the project's source of truth.**

## üìä **Validation**

- **Local Build**: ‚úÖ `flutter run -t lib/widgetbook/widgetbook.dart -d chrome` launches successfully and displays the themed components.
- **Specification Alignment**: ‚úÖ All code in `mobile/lib/src/core/design_system/` directly maps to the classes and values in `design_tokens.md`.
- **TDD Compliance**: ‚úÖ The "Red" tests from `t001` are now "Green". This completes the Red-Green cycle for the design system foundation.

## üöÄ **Impact & Next Steps**

This implementation **unblocks the entire Mobile MVP development plan** (`plan_cycle4_mobile_mvp.txt`).

### How to View the Design System:
1.  **Run Locally**:
    ```bash
    cd mobile
    flutter run -t lib/widgetbook/widgetbook.dart -d chrome
    ```
2.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
    - Merging these changes into the `main` branch will trigger the `.github/workflows/widgetbook-deploy.yml` workflow, which will automatically build and deploy the Widgetbook to a live URL for stakeholder review.

### Next Development Task:
- The project can now proceed with the next blocked tasks. According to the integration strategy, this would be **`t004: MVP Screen Validation Tests`** and **`t005: MVP Screen Specifications`** from the UI plan, followed by the main MVP implementation tasks (e.g., `plan_cycle4_mobile_mvp.txt` - `t001`).

## üéØ **Final Status**

**MVP DESIGN SYSTEM FOUNDATION: ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL & COMPLIANT**

- ‚úÖ **Build Status**: Green
- ‚úÖ **Specification Compliance**: 100%
- ‚úÖ **Unblocks Development**: Mobile MVP workstream is now unblocked.

**Confidence Level**: **HIGH**  
**Recommendation**: **PROCEED WITH MOBILE MVP TASKS**
