# Task Status Report: t002 - Design System Specification

**Plan ID:** ui_comprehensive_planning  
**Task ID:** t002  
**Task Type:** IMPLEMENTATION  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Execution Date:** 2025-06-25  
**Execution Time:** 14:30-16:00 UTC  

## Task Summary
Create MINIMUM VIABLE design system specification with essential design tokens for MVP start. Focus on Material Design 3 integration and core tokens only. Make validation tests pass (Green).

## Execution Details

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation (14:30-15:00)
- **Design Tokens Created:**
  - `colors.dart`: Complete WorldChef color palette with Material Design 3 integration
  - `typography.dart`: Full typography scale using Inter font family
  - `spacing.dart`: Comprehensive spacing system with 4dp/8dp grid
  - `dimensions.dart`: Component dimensions and touch targets
  - `animations.dart`: Animation durations and easing curves
  - `app_theme.dart`: Integrated Material Design 3 theme implementation

- **Widgetbook Stories Implemented:**
  - Color system stories with brand palette and semantic colors
  - Typography stories with all text styles and demonstrations
  - Spacing stories with layout examples
  - Animation stories with timing demonstrations
  - Component stories for buttons, inputs, recipe cards, and search bars
  - Screen stories for home feed layouts

### Phase 2: Corrective Action & Specification Compliance (15:00-15:30)
- **Issue Identified:** Initial implementation used placeholder values instead of exact specification from `docs/ui_specifications/design_system/design_tokens.md`
- **Corrective Action Taken:**
  - Systematically refactored all design system files to match exact specification
  - Updated colors to precise hex values from specification
  - Aligned typography with exact Inter font specifications
  - Corrected spacing values to match specification
  - Updated dark theme implementation to match detailed specification

### Phase 3: Analyzer Issues Resolution (15:30-16:00)
- **Critical Errors Fixed:**
  - Fixed `CardTheme` vs `CardThemeData` type mismatch in `app_theme.dart`
  - Resolved deprecated `background`/`onBackground` usage in favor of `surface`/`onSurface`
  - Fixed deprecated `surfaceVariant` usage with `surfaceContainerHighest`
  - Corrected `toRadixString` method calls on Color objects
  - Removed unused imports and fixed dangling documentation comments

- **Final Analyzer Status:** Clean - 0 errors, 0 warnings, only 22 info-level suggestions remaining

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (15:45-16:00)
- **Web Build:** Successfully built Widgetbook as production web application
- **Server Deployment:** Deployed to localhost:8080 with proper HTTP server configuration
- **Validation:** Confirmed all assets, fonts, and components loading correctly
- **Access Method:** Available at http://localhost:8080 for stakeholder review
