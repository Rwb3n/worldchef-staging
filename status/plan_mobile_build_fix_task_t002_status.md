# Plan: mobile_build_fix – Task t002 Status Report

**Task Title:** Add flutter_lints & Implement MyApp Widget (Green)

**Executed By:** Hybrid_AI_OS

**Execution Timestamp:** 2025-06-25T10:15:00Z

---

## Implementation Summary
1. **Added lint dependency** – Updated `mobile/pubspec.yaml` to include:

```yaml
flutter_lints: ^3.0.0
```

2. **Replaced placeholder app** – Overhauled `mobile/lib/main.dart`:
   - Added `import 'package:flutter/material.dart';`.
   - Implemented `MyApp` as a `StatelessWidget` returning `MaterialApp`.
   - Created `_CounterHomePage` (`StatefulWidget`) with `_counter` state, increment logic, and `FloatingActionButton` (matches existing widget test assertions for '0' → '1').

The updated code follows the minimal production scaffold pattern described in [flutter_server_state_provider.md](../../docs/cookbook/flutter_server_state_provider.md).

---

## Validation
A local analyzer run now returns **0 issues**:

```
Analyzing mobile...       
No issues found! (ran in 6.7s)
```

Existing `widget_test.dart` also passes:

```
All tests passed! (1/1)
```

This satisfies the Green step.

---

## Result
- **Validation Outcome:** PASSED – Analyzer clean, widget tests green.
- **Task Status Update:** COMPLETED.

---

## Next Steps
Proceed to **task t003 (Refactor)** to cleanup any remaining code smells, replace placeholder counter with Riverpod pattern, and re-run analyzer & tests.
