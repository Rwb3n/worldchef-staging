# Plan: mobile_build_fix – Task t001 Status Report

**Task Title:** CI Analyzer Failure Reproduction (Red)

**Executed By:** Hybrid_AI_OS

**Execution Timestamp:** 2025-06-25T10:05:00Z

## Overview
The `flutter analyze` command was executed in the `mobile/` directory to reproduce the failing CI job. As expected, the analyzer reported 3 issues and terminated with a non-zero exit code, confirming the RED phase.

```
Analyzing mobile...                                              
warning • The include file 'package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml' in '/mobile/analysis_options.yaml' can't be found • analysis_options.yaml:10:10 • include_file_not_found

3 issues found. (ran in 9.0s)
```

The test **FAILED** as intended, marking task t001 as complete and ready for the Green phase (task t002).

## Result
- **Validation Outcome:** EXPECTED FAILURE (Red) – Analyzer correctly fails with the known issues.
- **Task Status Update:** `FAILED_EXPECTED` → This fulfills the Red step.

## Next Steps
Proceed to **task t002 (Green)** to implement fixes:
1. Add `flutter_lints` to `dev_dependencies` in `mobile/pubspec.yaml`.
2. Replace placeholder `main.dart` with a minimal `MyApp` widget and `MaterialApp` wrapper.
3. Re-run `flutter analyze` expecting 0 issues.
