# Task Status Report

**Plan:** plan_widgetbook_version_fix.txt
**Task ID:** t001
**Task Type:** TEST_CREATION
**Status:** DONE
**Validator:** Hybrid_AI_OS
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-25

## Summary
Confirmed version mismatch between local and CI environments causing accessibility_tools compatibility issues.

## Actions Taken
1. Executed `flutter build web` locally - **SUCCESS** (builds fine with widgetbook 3.14.3)
2. Analyzed CI error - **FAILURE** with accessibility_tools 2.2.1 globalPosition error
3. Checked local dependencies - `widgetbook 3.14.3` â†’ `accessibility_tools 2.6.0` (compatible)

## Root Cause Analysis
- **pubspec.yaml**: `widgetbook: ^3.8.0` allows wide version range
- **Local**: Resolves to `widgetbook 3.14.3` with compatible `accessibility_tools 2.6.0`
- **CI**: Resolves to older widgetbook version with incompatible `accessibility_tools 2.2.1`

## Validation
Test properly demonstrates the issue (Red phase) - CI fails while local succeeds due to version resolution differences.

**Validation Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED

## Next Steps
Proceed to IMPLEMENTATION (task t002) to pin widgetbook to minimum compatible version.
