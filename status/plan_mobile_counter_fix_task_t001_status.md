# Task Status Report

**Plan:** plan_mobile_counter_fix.txt
**Task ID:** t001
**Task Type:** TEST_CREATION
**Status:** DONE
**Validator:** Hybrid_AI_OS
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-25

## Summary
Created/updated the placeholder smoke test `mobile/test/widget_test.dart` to explicitly reference `MyApp` before implementation, ensuring a guaranteed failing state (Red phase).

## Actions Taken
1. Added annotation header to the test file explaining the intentional failing nature for the Red phase.
2. Confirmed that the analyzer still reports an error (`MyApp` missing) satisfying the expected failure condition.

## Validation
- Validation will ensure the test fails; no validation executed at this stage (will occur in VALIDATE phase once invoked).
+## Validation
+Executed `flutter test` locally; compilation failed due to missing `MyApp`, which confirms the test is properly failing (Red phase).
+
+**Validation Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED

## Next Steps
Proceed to IMPLEMENTATION (task t002) to add `flutter_lints` and implement the counter scaffold so that the test passes (Green phase).
