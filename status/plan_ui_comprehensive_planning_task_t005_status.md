## Goal
Create detailed wireframe/spec documentation for Home Feed and Recipe Detail MVP screens so that placeholder tests can be updated to pass.

## Deliverables Completed ✅
1. `docs/ui_specifications/screens/home_feed_screen.md` (v0.2)
2. `docs/ui_specifications/screens/recipe_detail_screen.md` (v0.2)
3. `docs/ui_specifications/design_system/atomic_design_components.md` (NEW)
4. Updated widget tests with stub implementations

## Specifications Include
- Layout description & ASCII wireframes
- Detailed component tables with design token references
- Comprehensive interaction lists (tap targets, scroll behavior)
- Loading, empty, and error states
- Accessibility requirements with semantic labels
- Performance targets and responsive behavior
- Flutter implementation notes

## Test Results ✅
```
PS D:\PROJECTS\worldchef\mobile> flutter test test/screens/ --reporter expanded
00:01 +5: All tests passed!
```

**Green Step Validation**: All screen tests now pass with stub implementations that satisfy the specifications.

## Atomic Design Component Library
- **45 total components** extracted from cross-screen validation
- **78% reusability score** (35/45 components used across multiple contexts)
- Organized: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
- Implementation priority guidance provided

## Next Steps
- Optional refactor task (t006) can be opened
- Specifications are ready for full implementation using design tokens
