## ðŸŽ¯ **Plan Goal**
The goal of this plan was to update all relevant documentation after the large Widgetbook implementation effort and, crucially, to create an automated framework to prevent future documentation drift.

## âœ… **Outcome**
The plan was a success. All objectives were met.

### Key Artifacts and Changes:
1.  **Documentation Updated**: `docs/ui_specifications/README.md` and `mobile/lib/widgetbook/README.md` were both updated to reflect the current, completed state of the UI component library and its interactive Widgetbook catalog.
2.  **Validation Test Created**: A new linting test, `backend/__tests__/lint/widgetbook_coverage.test.ts`, was created. This test automatically scans the UI component and Widgetbook story directories and fails the build if any component is missing a corresponding story.
3.  **Iterative Improvement**: The validation test initially failed due to pathing issues and overly simplistic logic. It was iteratively improved until it correctly identified two genuinely missing stories (`WCCreatorInfoRow` and `WCBottomNavigation`).
4.  **Coverage Gaps Fixed**: The missing stories were implemented, and the test was re-run to confirm 100% coverage, proving the validation framework's effectiveness.
5.  **Process Documented**: A new cookbook recipe, `docs/cookbook/widgetbook_driven_development.md`, was created to document the new standard workflow, ensuring future development adheres to this quality gate.

This plan successfully closed out the final task of the `plan_widgetbook_ui_spec_alignment` and established a durable process for maintaining UI quality.
