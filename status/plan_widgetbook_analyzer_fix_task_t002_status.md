# Task Status Report

**Plan:** plan_widgetbook_analyzer_fix.txt
**Task ID:** t002
**Task Type:** IMPLEMENTATION
**Status:** DONE
**Validator:** Hybrid_AI_OS
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-25

## Summary
Successfully moved widgetbook dependencies from dev_dependencies to dependencies, resolving all `depend_on_referenced_packages` errors.

## Actions Taken
1. Moved `widgetbook: ^3.8.0` and `widgetbook_annotation: ^3.1.0` from dev_dependencies to dependencies in `mobile/pubspec.yaml`
2. Executed `flutter pub get` to update dependency resolution
3. Verified analyzer issues reduced from 122 to 112 (eliminated all import dependency errors)

## Validation
All `depend_on_referenced_packages` errors resolved. Remaining 112 issues are linting suggestions (use_super_parameters, prefer_const_constructors, deprecated_member_use) that can be auto-fixed.

**Validation Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED

## Next Steps
Proceed to REFACTORING (task t003) to apply dart fix --apply for remaining linter suggestions.
