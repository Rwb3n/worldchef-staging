- Detailed requirements for each task

### 2. Documentation Framework Established
✅ **Created organized documentation structure** (`docs/ui_specifications/`)
- Main index with clear directory organization
- Atomic Design Principles integration
- Comprehensive specification standards
- Status tracking and dependency management

### 3. Design System Planning
✅ **Design tokens specification structure** (`docs/ui_specifications/design_system/design_tokens.md`)
- Explicit clarifying questions requiring stakeholder input

- Validation requirements and Flutter integration specifications

### 4. Screen Specification Framework
✅ **Home Feed screen specification structure** (`docs/ui_specifications/screens/home_feed_screen.md`)
- Detailed layout anatomy with exact measurements
- Component specifications with explicit requirements
- State management definitions (loading, error, offline)
- Accessibility and internationalization requirements
- Performance requirements aligned with aiconfig.json targets

### 5. User Flow Documentation
✅ **Discovery flow specification structure** (`docs/ui_specifications/user_flows/discovery_flow.md`)
- Complete user journey mapping
- Decision points and error paths explicitly defined
- Animation and transition specifications
- Analytics tracking point identification
- Performance requirements for each flow step

## Explicit Documentation of All UI Planning Discussions

### Design System Decisions
1. **Material Design 3 Base**: Confirmed as foundation with WorldChef customizations
2. **Atomic Design Principles**: Adopted for component organization (Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages)
3. **Flutter Theming**: Will leverage Flutter's built-in theming with custom extensions
4. **Design Token Management**: All design decisions must be captured as explicit tokens

### Screen Requirements Established
1. **7 MVP Screens Identified**: Home Feed, Recipe Detail, Recipe Creation, Search, Checkout, Profile, Onboarding
2. **Performance Targets**: ≥58 FPS, ≤1.5s TTI, ≤50ms optimistic updates (from aiconfig.json)
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance required for all screens
4. **Internationalization**: RTL support and string externalization required

### Component Library Strategy
1. **Reusable Components**: RecipeCard, SearchBar, FilterChips, LoadingIndicators, ErrorStates
2. **State Management**: All components must define explicit states (default, loading, error, disabled)
3. **API Specifications**: All components require explicit prop definitions and usage guidelines
4. **Testing**: Visual regression tests and accessibility tests required

### User Flow Requirements
1. **5 Primary Flows**: Onboarding, Discovery, Creation, Purchase, Engagement
2. **Entry/Exit Points**: Explicitly defined for each flow
3. **Error Handling**: Complete error recovery patterns required
4. **Analytics**: Tracking points identified for each user journey

## Critical Clarifying Questions Identified

**These questions MUST be answered before implementation can proceed:**

### Brand & Visual Identity
1. **Brand Color Palette**: Exact colors and Material Design 3 role mappings
2. **Typography**: Specific font requirements beyond Material Design 3 defaults
3. **Image Specifications**: Exact aspect ratios and sizing for recipe cards/details

### Interaction Design
4. **Animation Specifications**: Duration and easing requirements for transitions
5. **Spacing Requirements**: Exact layout grid and spacing system
6. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens vs spinners preference
7. **Error Messaging**: Specific error state visual and messaging requirements
8. **Offline Indicators**: Visual indicators and messaging for offline states

## Technical Implementation Framework

### Test-Driven Development Structure
- **TEST_CREATION (Red)**: Failing tests created first for each specification
- **IMPLEMENTATION (Green)**: Specifications created to make tests pass
- **REFACTORING (Refactor)**: Optimization and tooling added

### Validation Requirements
- Automated design token compliance testing
- Visual regression testing for all components
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Performance testing for all interactions

### Dependencies Clearly Defined
1. **Design System** → **Component Library** → **Screen Specifications** → **User Flows**
2. **Stakeholder Input** → **Design Tokens** → **All Implementation**
3. **Failing Tests** → **Specifications** → **Validation**

## Integration with Existing Project

### Alignment with Current Plans
- **Mobile MVP Plan**: `plans/plan_cycle4_mobile_mvp.txt` tasks t001-t003 (Home Feed)
- **Gap Closure Plan**: `plans/plan_gap_closure.txt` completed as prerequisite
- **Architecture**: Consistent with `docs/architecture/mobile-client.md`

### Technology Stack Integration
- **Flutter 3.x**: Confirmed mobile framework
- **Material Design 3**: Base design system
- **Riverpod**: State management for UI state
- **Performance Targets**: Aligned with validated aiconfig.json metrics

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **Scope Creep**: Mitigated by explicit task boundaries and success criteria
2. **Analysis Paralysis**: Mitigated by TDD approach requiring working tests/specs
3. **Stakeholder Dependencies**: Mitigated by explicit clarifying questions list

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Design Iteration**: Mitigated by version-locked specifications and change control
2. **Component Complexity**: Mitigated by Atomic Design principles and clear APIs
3. **Performance Compliance**: Mitigated by explicit performance testing requirements

## Next Steps & Execution Plan

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Stakeholder Input**: Answer all 8 clarifying questions before task execution
2. **Task t001 Execution**: Create failing design system validation tests
3. **Task t004 Execution**: Create failing screen validation tests
4. **Task t007 Execution**: Create failing component validation tests
5. **Task t010 Execution**: Create failing user flow validation tests

### Implementation Sequence
1. **Phase 1**: Create all failing tests (tasks t001, t004, t007, t010)
2. **Phase 2**: Create specifications to make tests pass (tasks t002, t005, t008, t011)
3. **Phase 3**: Refactor and optimize specifications (tasks t003, t006, t009, t012)
