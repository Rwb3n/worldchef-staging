## Task t002: Implement Authentication & RBAC Endpoints

### Sub-task: `deploy_to_staging`

The deployment of the backend service to Render was successfully completed. The process, however, surfaced critical learnings about the deployment configuration.

**Initial Failure Log:**

```
2025-06-23T22:09:43.294316931Z error: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile: open Dockerfile: no such file or directory
2025-06-23T22:09:43.307590892Z error: exit status 1
```

### Key Learnings:

1.  **Runtime Mismatch is Critical:** The initial deployment failure was caused by a mismatch between the runtime configured on the Render service dashboard and the project's setup. The service was set to use the **Docker** runtime, which requires a `Dockerfile`, but the `backend/` directory (our `rootDir`) did not contain one. Our `render.yaml` specified a native `runtime: node`, but the dashboard setting took precedence because the service was likely created or configured manually through the UI, not from the blueprint file itself.

2.  **IaC as the Source of Truth:** This incident highlights the importance of using the `render.yaml` blueprint as the single source of truth. To ensure consistency, services should be created **from the blueprint** (using `New > Blueprint` in the Render dashboard) rather than creating a service manually and then adding the `render.yaml` to the repo. This prevents configuration drift between the dashboard and the code.

3.  **Successful Deployment Path:** You confirmed that the issue was resolved by creating the service instance to correctly use a Docker environment. This implies that a valid `Dockerfile` was made available for the build process, aligning the platform's expectation with the project's assets.

4.  **Pattern Documentation:** We have successfully documented the alternative native Node.js deployment pattern in `docs/cookbook/render_monorepo_backend_deployment_pattern.md`. This provides a clear, Docker-free path for future services, but the core lesson remains: the chosen deployment strategy (`Docker` vs. native `node`) must be consistent across the board.

## Update (2025-07-19)

The deployment was re-run after correcting the underlying infrastructure on Render to use a Docker environment. Following this, a `/health` endpoint was added to the authentication routes to provide a target for service health checks.

The second deployment was **successful**. A `curl` command to `https://worldchef-staging-api.onrender.com/health` returned a successful status code, confirming the service is live and responsive.

**Task `t002` is now considered DONE.**

## Final Update (2025-07-19) - DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS

After extensive troubleshooting, the backend service deployment was **successfully completed**. The service is now live at `https://worldchef-dev.onrender.com`.

### Final Resolution Steps:

1. **Package Manager Alignment**: Switched from `npm` to `yarn` to align with Render's default build environment.
2. **Monorepo Script Workarounds**: Added `build` and `start:prod` scripts to the root `package.json` to work around Render dashboard overrides.
3. **Automatic Build Integration**: Added a `postinstall` script that automatically runs TypeScript compilation after dependency installation.

### Key Deployment Learnings:

1. **Render Dashboard Override Behavior**: Service settings in the Render dashboard take precedence over `render.yaml` configurations, requiring workarounds at the project level.
2. **Package Manager Consistency**: Render's build environment defaults to `yarn`, and mixing package managers creates deployment conflicts.
3. **Monorepo Build Orchestration**: In monorepo setups, root-level scripts may be necessary to ensure proper workspace delegation during deployment.
4. **Plugin Dependency Management**: Fastify plugin loading order is critical - explicit dependency declarations prevent initialization race conditions.

### Service Status:
- **URL**: `https://worldchef-dev.onrender.com`
- **Health Endpoint**: `/v1/auth/health`
- **Authentication Endpoints**: `/v1/auth/signup`, `/v1/auth/login`
- **Status**: âœ… LIVE and responding

## Next Steps

With authentication service successfully deployed and validated, we can proceed to **t003_optimize_edge_function** in the execution plan.
