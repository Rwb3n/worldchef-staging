# Task t003 Status Report: Add Dependency Override for accessibility_tools

**Plan ID**: plan_widgetbook_version_fix  
**Task ID**: t003  
**Task Type**: IMPLEMENTATION  
**Execution Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Status**: DONE  

## Task Description
Add explicit dependency override for accessibility_tools to force compatible version in CI

## Actions Completed

### 1. Added dependency_overrides Section
- **File Modified**: `mobile/pubspec.yaml`
- **Change**: Added `dependency_overrides` section with `accessibility_tools: ^2.6.0`
- **Rationale**: Force CI to use accessibility_tools 2.6.0+ which has the compatible DragEndDetails.globalPosition API

### 2. Verified Override Application
- **Command**: `flutter pub get`
- **Result**: `! accessibility_tools 2.6.0 (overridden)` confirms override is active
- **Impact**: All environments now forced to use compatible version

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Problem**: CI was resolving to accessibility_tools 2.2.1 which lacks DragEndDetails.globalPosition
- **Local Environment**: Was correctly using accessibility_tools 2.6.0 via widgetbook 3.14.3
- **CI Environment**: Was falling back to older version due to looser constraints

### Solution Implementation
```yaml
dependency_overrides:
  accessibility_tools: ^2.6.0
```

This override ensures that regardless of what widgetbook's dependency tree suggests, we always use accessibility_tools 2.6.0 or higher.

## Validation Results

### Dependency Resolution
- **Before**: Mixed versions (local 2.6.0, CI 2.2.1)
- **After**: Forced 2.6.0 in all environments
- **Override Status**: Active (`! accessibility_tools 2.6.0 (overridden)`)

## Expected Outcome
pubspec.yaml updated with dependency_overrides section forcing accessibility_tools >=2.6.0

## Actual Outcome  
âœ… **ACHIEVED**: dependency_overrides section successfully added and verified active

## Next Steps
- Task t004: Verify complete build pipeline works with no regressions

## Notes
- Dependency overrides are a powerful tool for resolving version conflicts
- This fix should resolve the CI build failure while maintaining local development compatibility
- The override is minimal and targeted - only affects the problematic package
