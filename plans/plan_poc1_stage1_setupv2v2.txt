  "scope": [
    "A. Project Setup & Minimal CI (validation and enhancement of Stage 1 setup)",
    "B. Media-Heavy Recipe List Screen with performance-optimized image loading and virtualization (approx. 50 items)",
    "C. Recipe Detail Screen with core data structure and UI components",
    "D. Basic Navigation between list and detail screens with proper routing",
    "E. Simple Shared UI State & Persistence using a chosen Flutter pattern (Provider or Riverpod, to be confirmed pre-task)",

    "Advanced accessibility features beyond semantic labels and basic screen reader checks",
    "Complete internationalization beyond basic string externalization and one example of pluralization/interpolation",
    "Custom UI components beyond Material Design adaptation or those essential for PoC scope",
    "Complex backend-driven search/filtering for recipe list (simple client-side filter on loaded data is acceptable if lightweight)"
