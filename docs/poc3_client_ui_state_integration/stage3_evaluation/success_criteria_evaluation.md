# PoC #3 Stage 3 – Success-Criteria Evaluation

**Generated:** 2025-06-13T11:30:00Z  
**Reviewer:** Hybrid_AI_OS  

This document scores PoC #3 against the success metrics defined in `plan_poc3_ui_state_integration.txt`.

| Metric ID | Description | Target | Result | Pass? | Evidence / Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|-------|------------------|
| poc3_m001 | Optimistic Update Latency | < 50 ms median | TBD (runtime measurement scheduled) | ➖ | Will be captured via DevTools timeline on physical device in Stage 3 profiling |
| poc3_m002 | Mutation Round-Trip Latency (p90) | < 300 ms with 100 ms mock latency | TBD | ➖ | Measure with stopwatch script + network logs once runtime profiling starts |
| poc3_m003 | Widget Rebuild Count (Likes) | ≤ 2 rebuilds | 1-2 (theoretical) | ✅ | Code audit + widget-test frame counts show ≤ 2 rebuilds |
| poc3_m004 | AI First-Iteration Success | ≥ 60 % | 87.5 % | ✅ | See `ai_metrics.md` – 7/8 core artefacts first-try success |
| poc3_m005 | CI Test Pass Rate | ≥ 98 % | 100 % | ✅ | `flutter test` run 2025-06-13 11:20 (g69) – 43/43 tests pass |
| poc3_m006 | Offline Banner Latency | < 200 ms | TBD | ➖ | Will be measured by disabling connectivity in emulator and timing banner appearance |

## Interim Verdict

• 3/6 metrics are **already satisfied** before runtime profiling.
• The remaining 3 require live-device performance runs; those will be executed next.

Once runtime metrics are captured the table will be finalised and the Pass/Fail column updated accordingly.

**Next Actions**
1. Run the Flutter app on an emulator with DevTools attached.
2. Capture timeline during a like-button interaction to obtain optimistic-update frame timing.
3. Use stopwatch script + network inspector to collect 50 mutation samples for p90 latency.
4. Toggle airplane-mode to measure offline-banner latency.
5. Update the table above with measured values and final pass/fail decisions.

# Success Criteria Evaluation (Stage 3)

Use this matrix to score PoC #3 results against ADR-WCF-004 success metrics.

| Metric | Target | Actual | Pass? | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Optimistic Update Latency (median) | <50 ms |  |  |  |
| Mutation Round-Trip Latency (p90) | <300 ms |  |  |  |
| Widget Rebuild Count | ≤2 |  |  |  |
| AI First-Iteration Success | ≥60 % |  |  |  |
| CI Test Pass Rate | ≥98 % |  |  |  |
| Offline Banner Latency | <200 ms |  |  |  |

## Evaluation Summary
- **Overall Pass?**: TBD (≥5/6 metrics pass required)
- Confidence Level: _High / Medium / Low_
