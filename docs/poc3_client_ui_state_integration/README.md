# PoC #3: Client UI State + Server State Library Integration

**Mandated by:** ADR-WCF-004 (Client UI State Management Strategy)  
**Related ADRs:** ADR-WCF-001a (Flutter stack), ADR-WCF-025 (Mobile Foundation), ADR-WCF-003 (Backend Architecture), ADR-WCF-001d (Database), ADR-WCF-005 (Auth)

## 📑 Purpose
This documentation hub captures all artifacts, reports, and evidence generated during **PoC #3**, whose objective is to validate seamless, maintainable patterns for integrating Flutter UI state (Riverpod) with server state (Supabase API) under realistic mobile conditions.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
```
docs/
└─ poc3_client_ui_state_integration/
   ├─ stage0_setup/         # environment, dependency setup, prompt templates
   ├─ stage1_implementation/ # core feature implementation artifacts
   ├─ stage2_validation/     # performance, DX, test results, AI metrics
   ├─ stage3_evaluation/     # success-criteria evaluation & final recommendation
   └─ README.md              # you are here
```
Stages map 1:1 to the tasks defined in **plan_poc3_client_state_integration.txt** (to be created).

## 🎯 Key Success Metrics (excerpt)
1. Optimistic like update visible <50 ms (median).
2. Mutation round-trip p90 <300 ms with mock latency 80-150 ms.
3. ≤2 widget rebuilds on like flow (Flutter DevTools).
4. AI first-iteration success ≥60 % for provider/mutation code.
5. All unit/widget tests pass reliably in CI (≥98 %).
6. Offline banner visible within 200 ms of connectivity change.

## 📅 Timeline (tentative)
| Stage | Focus | Target Duration |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 0 | Project & ADR alignment, dependency setup | Day 1 |
| 1 | Core implementation (List, Detail, Like flow) | Days 2-4 |
| 2 | Validation & profiling | Days 5-6 |
| 3 | Evaluation & documentation | Day 7 |
