ADR-WCF-001a: Mobile Client Technology Stack Selection Strategy
Status: VALIDATED (Flutter)
Date: 2025-06-13 (Validated)
Authors: WorldChef Mobile Team

1. Context
WorldChef requires a cross-platform mobile framework. Flutter and React-Native (new architecture) were evaluated via PoC-#1.

2. Decision Drivers
• Performance (startup, FPS)
• AI-assisted code-generation effectiveness
• Developer-experience survey
• Community & ecosystem health
• Consistency across iOS/Android builds

3. Considered Options
A. Flutter 3.x (Dart)
B. React-Native 0.73 New-Arch (TypeScript)

4. Evaluation Summary (PoC-#1)
| Metric | Flutter | React-Native |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Launch time (cold) | 1.2 s | 2.5 s |
| Steady-state FPS (media grid) | 58–60 | 45–50 |
| Widget/Component boilerplate LOC | 420 | 610 |
| AI first-iteration success | 88 % | 63 % |
| Build size (release, Android) | 23 MB | 34 MB |
| Dev-cycle hot-reload avg | 0.9 s | 2.2 s |

5. Decision
**Choose Flutter 3.x** as the official mobile technology stack.

6. Consequences
Positive: superior performance, tighter AI integration, single binary tool-chain, robust DevTools.
Negative: Larger initial APK than pure native, team must learn Dart.

7. Validation Artifacts
• PoC1 test_run_stack_compare.log SHA-256 9A… (see docs/poc1_mobile_stack_selection)

8. Revisit Criteria
Quarterly review; if Flutter ecosystem degrades or critical RN-only SDK emerges, re-evaluate.
