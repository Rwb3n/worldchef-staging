   - âœ… LCOV format generation for coverage analysis
   - âœ… Codecov integration for coverage tracking

2. **Build Performance Profiling**
   - âœ… Build time measurement for APK and AAB
   - âœ… Build artifact size tracking
   - âœ… Performance metrics logging

3. **Build Artifact Caching**
   - âœ… Flutter dependencies caching (.pub-cache, .dart_tool)
   - âœ… Optimized cache keys using pubspec.lock hash
   - âœ… Extended artifact retention (30 days)

4. **Enhanced Metadata Collection**
   - âœ… Build performance reports generation
   - âœ… Flutter version tracking in CI logs
   - âœ… Artifact size monitoring

## Development Metrics Baseline

### Performance Expectations (Target Measurements)
| Metric | Expected Range | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Cold Start Time** | <3s (debug build) | Manual measurement on target devices |
| **Hot Reload Time** | <500ms | IDE measurement during development |
| **Full Build Time** | <2min (debug), <5min (release) | CI pipeline measurement |
| **APK Size (Debug)** | <50MB | CI artifact size measurement |
| **APK Size (Release)** | <25MB | Release build measurement |

### Current Baseline Measurements (Task F001)
| Metric | Current Value | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------------|---------|-------|
| **Project Size (Source)** | ~15KB | âœ… Measured | Basic project structure only |
| **Dependencies Count** | 5 core packages | âœ… Measured | http, shared_preferences, cached_network_image, cupertino_icons, flutter |
| **CI Pipeline Duration** | ~3-5min estimated | ðŸ“Š Framework Ready | Will measure on first CI run |
| **Flutter Doctor Status** | âœ… All checks pass | âœ… Confirmed | SDK operational, development ready |
| **Hot Reload Capability** | âœ… Available | âœ… Confirmed | Framework supports instant refresh |
| **Build Targets** | Android + iOS | âœ… Configured | Platform configurations validated |

### Measurement Framework Established
- **âœ… CI Performance Tracking**: Build time and artifact size monitoring in pipeline
- **âœ… Development Velocity Tracking**: Hot reload and iteration speed measurement points
- **âœ… Memory Usage Baseline**: Framework ready for runtime memory monitoring
- **ðŸ“Š Pending First Measurements**: Cold start, full build times, actual APK sizes (will be captured during F003 implementation)

**Note**: Specific runtime performance measurements (cold start, hot reload timing, build durations) will be captured during feature implementation tasks F002-F003 when the app has actual functionality to measure.

## Development Workflow Validation

### Development Workflow Validation
- âœ… **Project Initialization**: Complete and functional
- âœ… **Dependency Management**: pubspec.yaml properly configured
- âœ… **Code Quality**: Linting rules active via flutter_lints
- âœ… **Testing Infrastructure**: flutter_test framework ready
- âœ… **Platform Support**: Android and iOS targets configured

## AI Assistance Integration Points

### Prompt Template Compatibility
- âœ… **Flutter UI Components**: Ready for Material Design generation
- âœ… **API Integration**: HTTP service templates applicable
- âœ… **State Management**: Provider/Riverpod templates prepared
- âœ… **Testing Patterns**: Unit test templates available

### Development Efficiency Factors
- âœ… **Hot Reload**: Rapid iteration capability confirmed
- âœ… **Package Ecosystem**: Rich pub.dev ecosystem accessible
