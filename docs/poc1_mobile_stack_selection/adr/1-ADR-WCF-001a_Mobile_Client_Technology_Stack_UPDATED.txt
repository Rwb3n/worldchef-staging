1. Context and Problem Statement
The WorldChef project requires a high-performance, maintainable mobile client for iOS and Android, to be developed with significant AI code generation (target 99.9%) under limited human oversight capacity (20h/week). The application will be media-heavy. The foundational decision of the mobile technology stack (React Native vs. Flutter) carries profound implications. This ADR mandated a rigorous, comparative Proof-of-Concept (PoC) phase to gather empirical evidence before a final stack commitment, ensuring the choice aligns with performance NFRs, AI-assisted development efficiency, and overall project goals.

**PoC COMPLETED**: The mandated comparative PoC was successfully executed and completed on 2025-06-07.

2. Decision Drivers
Performance for Media-Heavy Application (Critical): Must achieve smooth 60fps scrolling for image-laden lists and fast screen loads (p95 TTI <1.5-2s) on defined mid-range test devices.
AI Code Generation Effectiveness & Human Oversight Efficiency: Chosen stack must enable AI to generate high-quality, idiomatic, performant code, with human review/optimization effort fitting within capacity.
High-Quality, Branded User Experience: Ability to implement Figma designs with fidelity.
Cross-Platform Development Efficiency & Single Codebase.
Development Velocity (MVP): Enable rapid iteration.
Native Feature Access, Offline Capability, Accessibility & Internationalization.
Ecosystem, Testability, Long-Term Maintainability.

**PoC FINDINGS**: Flutter demonstrated clear advantages across all critical decision drivers, particularly in testing infrastructure reliability and AI development effectiveness.
