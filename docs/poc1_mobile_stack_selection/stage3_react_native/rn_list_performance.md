# React Native List Performance Report

> **Note**: This list performance analysis reflects the **initial React Native implementation** (pre-enhancement). These measurements were taken before the RN-ENH enhancement phase. The enhancement phase focused on error handling, testing infrastructure, and type safety improvements rather than list performance optimization.

This document captures the performance metrics for the React Native recipe list screen.
