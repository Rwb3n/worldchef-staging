# React Native Performance Data Summary

> **Note**: This performance data reflects the **initial React Native implementation state** (pre-enhancement). The measurements were taken before the RN-ENH enhancement phase that added sophisticated error handling, testing infrastructure, and enhanced type safety. The functional enhancements in the RN-ENH phase focused on development experience and code quality rather than runtime performance optimization.

# React Native Performance Data Summary

This document summarizes the performance metrics collected during the React Native PoC and compares them with the Flutter PoC.

## Metrics

| Metric | React Native | Flutter | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App Size (Android) | | | |
| App Size (iOS) | | | |
| Memory Usage (Android) | | | |
| Memory Usage (iOS) | | | |
| Scrolling FPS (Android) | | | |
| Scrolling FPS (iOS) | | | |
| Time to Interactive (TTI) | | | |
| Cold Start Time | | | |
| Fast Refresh Time | | | |
| Initial Metro Bundle Time (Dev) | | | |
| Initial Metro Bundle Time (Release) | | | |

## How to Reproduce Metrics

*   **App Size**: Measured using the size of the generated APK/IPA files.
*   **Memory Usage**: Measured using the Android Studio Profiler and Xcode Instruments.
*   **Scrolling FPS**: Measured using the Flipper Performance Monitor and React DevTools Profiler.
*   **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Measured using the React DevTools Profiler.
*   **Cold Start Time**: Measured by timing the app's launch from a killed state.
*   **Fast Refresh Time**: Measured by timing how long it takes for a change to appear on the screen.
*   **Initial Metro Bundle Time**: Measured by timing the initial bundle build process.

### Tooling Versions

*   **Flipper**:
*   **React DevTools**:
*   **Expo CLI**:
*   **Metro**:
