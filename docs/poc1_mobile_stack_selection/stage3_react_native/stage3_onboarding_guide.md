# Stage 3 Onboarding Guide - WorldChef React Native PoC Implementation

Welcome to Stage 3 of the WorldChef Mobile Stack Comparison PoC. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the React Native implementation tasks and serves as your central hub for all development-related documentation for this stage.

## Purpose & Overview

Stage 3 focuses on implementing the WorldChef mobile application using React Native, based on the features and scope defined in the approved plan. The primary goal is to build a feature-equivalent application to the Flutter PoC (completed in Stage 2) to enable a direct, evidence-based comparison between the two technology stacks. This includes evaluating performance, developer experience (DX), AI-assisted development efficiency, and the implementation of non-functional requirements (NFRs).

## Quick Start Checklist

Use this checklist to track your progress through Stage 3 implementation tasks as defined in `plan_poc1_stage3_rn_impl.txt`:

- [ ] **Task RN001** - Validate React Native project setup, enable New Architecture, and enhance CI pipeline.
- [ ] **Task RN002** - Create TypeScript data models and an API service layer for recipes.
- [ ] **Task RN003** - Implement the media-heavy recipe list screen with FlatList optimizations.
- [ ] **Task RN004** - Build the recipe detail screen with core data and UI components.
- [ ] **Task RN005** - Implement navigation between the list and detail screens.
- [ ] **Task RN006** - Set up simple shared UI state and persistence (e.g., theme toggle).
- [ ] **Task RN007** - Implement a basic offline caching stub for the recipe list.
- [ ] **Task RN008** - Add basic accessibility (A11y) and internationalization (i18n) stubs.
- [ ] **Task RN009** - Consolidate all performance metrics and DX documentation for final analysis.

## Development Environment Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets the following requirements as established in Stage 1:

### Common Prerequisites
- **Git** & **GitHub Account**
- **Code Editor** (VS Code recommended)
- **Mock Data Server** running locally (`worldchef_poc_mock_server`)

### React Native-Specific Requirements
- **Node.js** - Latest LTS version
- **Expo CLI** - Latest stable version
- **EAS CLI** - For advanced build configurations
- **Android Studio** - Latest stable version
- **Xcode** - Latest stable (macOS only, for iOS development)

### Testing Requirements
- **Physical Devices** - Google Pixel 5 (Android 12+), iPhone 11 (iOS 15+)
- **Emulators/Simulators** - Android API 31+, iOS 15+ simulator

## Implementation Process Overview

This stage follows the task sequence outlined in the `plan_poc1_stage3_rn_impl.txt`.

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Task RN001)**
    *   Validate project setup and CI pipeline.
    *   Enable New Architecture (Fabric + TurboModules).
    *   Establish baseline development metrics.
    *   **CRITICAL**: Pass Go/No-Go checkpoint for New Architecture stability.

2.  **Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation (Tasks RN002 - RN005)**
    *   Build the data layer (models, services).
    *   Implement the recipe list and detail screens with a focus on performance.
    *   Set up navigation between screens.

3.  **Phase 3: NFRs & State Management (Tasks RN006 - RN008)**
    *   Implement theme state management and persistence.
    *   Add stubs for offline caching, A11y, and i18n.

4.  **Phase 4: Analysis & Documentation (Task RN009)**
    *   Consolidate all collected performance data and DX notes.
    *   Compile the final comparative analysis against the Flutter PoC.

## Key Success Criteria

By the end of Stage 3, the following criteria must be met, as defined in `plan_poc1_stage3_rn_impl.txt`:

âœ… **Feature Parity** - All features (Scope A-G) implemented for React Native, matching the Flutter PoC.
âœ… **Performance Targets Met** - Performance data (FPS, TTI, Memory) collected and comparable to the Flutter baseline.
âœ… **Time Constraints Respected** - Total human oversight for this stage remains within the **20-25 hour** budget.
âœ… **Quality Standards Achieved** - NFR stubs are functional and unit tests are in place for the data layer.
âœ… **Comprehensive Data Collection** - All DX, AI effectiveness, and effort metrics are meticulously logged.
âœ… **Comparative Analysis Ready** - All data is compiled and ready for the final Stage 4 report.

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues
- **New Architecture:** Expect potential issues with third-party libraries. Refer to official React Native and library documentation for compatibility.
- **Dependency Conflicts:** Use `npx expo-doctor` and `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` as needed to resolve dependency tree issues.
- **Build Failures:** Check Android Studio/Xcode configurations and ensure all native dependencies are correctly linked.
- **CI Failures:** Review workflow logs for errors in dependency installation, caching, or script execution.

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Stage 3, the project will move to:

- **Stage 4** - **Comparative Analysis & Final Reporting**: In-depth analysis of the data collected from both the Flutter and React Native PoCs to produce the final recommendation and decision-making report.
