## Key Discoveries & Lessons

### Testing Infrastructure Reality Check
**Critical Finding**: Testing infrastructure emerged as the decisive factor, not performance or features.
- **Expected**: Close competition on performance metrics
- **Reality**: Testing reliability became the ultimate differentiator
- **Lesson**: **Production confidence trumps minor performance differences**

### Environment Configuration Complexity
**Critical Finding**: React Native's Expo Go development environment creates ongoing complexity.
- **Issue**: `localhost:3000` vs `10.181.47.230:3000` endpoint mismatches
- **Solution**: Environment-based API URL configuration required
- **Impact**: **Additional configuration management overhead**

### AI Development Effectiveness Gap
**Measured Result**: Flutter enabled more efficient AI-assisted development.
- **Flutter**: 96% first-iteration success rate
- **React Native**: 85% first-iteration success rate  
- **Impact**: **Faster development cycles, reduced debugging time**
