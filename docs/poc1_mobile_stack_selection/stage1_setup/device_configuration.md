3. Verify IP address configuration
4. Test with curl: `curl http://[IP]:3000/recipes`

#### CORS Issues
- Verify device IP is in CORS whitelist
- Check browser developer tools for CORS errors
- Update mock server CORS configuration if needed

## Performance Testing Setup

### Baseline Measurements
- Record native app launch times
- Measure network request latency without throttling
- Establish device performance baselines

### Throttled Network Testing
- Configure consistent 3G simulation
- Measure API response times with network latency
- Test offline/online transitions

## Security Considerations

### Development Certificates
- Use debug certificates only for development
- Rotate certificates if compromised
- Store provisioning profiles securely

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for production servers
- Implement certificate pinning for production
- Monitor network traffic during testing

## Summary

This configuration guide ensures consistent testing environments across both Flutter and React Native PoCs. All devices should be configured with:

1. **Physical Devices**: USB debugging enabled, development certificates installed
2. **Virtual Devices**: Consistent OS versions and hardware configurations
3. **Network Simulation**: 3G throttling for realistic testing conditions
4. **Mock Server Access**: Proper IP configuration for all target devices

**Next Steps**: After completing device configuration, proceed with AI tooling setup (Task 005) and time tracking setup (Task 006), then perform integration smoke testing (Task 008).
