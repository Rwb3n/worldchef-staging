1. Project Title
Cycle 4: Engineering & Mobile Delivery for Closed-Beta
2. Purpose & Background
Following successful validation of our architecture (via ADRs and PoCs), Cycle 4 transitions WorldChef from blueprint to beta‑ready product. This cycle will deliver core backend services, mobile experiences, and quality gates to support a controlled closed‑beta launch.
3. Objectives
Backend: Implement authentication, recipe management, search, and payment stub APIs.
Mobile: Ship home feed, recipe detail, and checkout screens with offline support and push notifications.
Quality: Achieve coverage, performance, and security targets.
Launch: Reach a go/no‑go decision for closed‑beta by end of Week 6.
4. Scope
In-Scope:
User onboarding (sign-up, login, logout, password reset)
Recipe feed, detail, creation, and discovery
Happy‑path Stripe checkout stub
Push notifications (opt‑in, token registration, deep links)
OpenAPI spec publication and staging environment
CI/CD pipelines, test automation, and monitoring setup


Out-of-Scope:
Subscription & recurring payments
Advanced analytics & feature flags
Internationalization beyond English
Refunds/disputes and offline sync beyond basic cache

8. Assumptions
Figma designs locked by Day 0
Staging and CI/CD tools fully operational Week 0
Key personnel remain allocated across 6 weeks
MVP scope stable unless formal change request
Third‑party SLAs (Stripe, Supabase, Search) ≥99.9%
Budget cap of £75/month holds
9. Constraints & Dependencies
Reliance on Stripe test environment and API versioning
Supabase auth, database, and edge-function services
Typesense/Meilisearch availability for search
GitHub Actions runner quotas and licenses for ZAP/k6
10. High‑Level Risks & Mitigations
Risk
Mitigation
Edge-function warm latency
Fallback to in‑process worker if >300 ms
CI runner limits
Monitor usage; optimize test suites
Design changes mid-cycle
Enforce scope-change tickets
Third‑party downtime
Alerting and retry policies; SLA escalation

11. Governance & Communication
Daily: Squad stand-ups (15 min)
Weekly: Cross-functional status reviews (30 min)
Biweekly: Leadership sync (60 min)
Artifacts: Confluence page, shared Slack channel, status dashboard
