# PoC #4: Backend Integration Validation

**Status**: REQUIRED - Critical Validation Gap Identified  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks parallel execution  
**Dependencies**: Must complete before Phase 2 (Production Infrastructure Setup)

## Context & Problem Statement

While PoCs #1-3 validated our core technology stack (Flutter, Supabase, Riverpod), we have a **critical validation gap** for backend service integrations that are essential for MVP functionality. These integrations represent operational risks that could impact production readiness.

## Validation Gap Analysis

**Validated Components:**
- ✅ Mobile framework performance (Flutter)
- ✅ Database/BaaS performance (Supabase) 
- ✅ State management patterns (Riverpod)

**Unvalidated Components:**
- ❌ API server performance under load (Fastify)
- ❌ Payment integration end-to-end flow (Stripe)
- ❌ Push notification delivery reliability (FCM)

## Success Criteria

**Overall PoC Success**: All 3 spikes must achieve "VALIDATED" status
**Timeline**: Complete within 2 weeks to maintain Phase 2 schedule
**Evidence**: Tamper-evident logs and performance data for each spike

## Spike 1: Fastify Performance Validation

**Objective**: Confirm Fastify meets performance and DX requirements under load

**Tasks:**
1. Scaffold Fastify server with `/ping` GET and `/echo` POST routes
2. Implement JSON schema validation (fastify-schema or zod)
3. Add middleware: request logging, JWT parsing stub
4. Execute k6 load test: 100 virtual users, 60s duration
5. Record and analyze latency metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- Server boot time: ≤500ms
- POST /echo rejects malformed JSON bodies
- k6 p95 latency: ≤200ms (matches backend performance target)
- Schema validation logs confirm proper operation

**Deliverables:**
- Code in `spike/fastify-validation` branch
- k6 summary JSON with performance metrics
- Decision: "VALIDATED" or "RECONSIDER" with rationale

**Risk Mitigation**: If Fastify fails, evaluate Express.js or Koa alternatives

## Spike 2: Stripe Checkout + Webhook Integration

**Objective**: Validate payment flow and webhook security end-to-end

**Tasks:**
1. Create test product + price in Stripe sandbox (already available)
2. Implement POST `/payments/checkout` session creation
3. Build POST `/webhooks/stripe` endpoint with signature validation
4. Use Stripe CLI to trigger test webhooks
5. Validate webhook signature verification (success + failure cases)

**Success Criteria:**
- Test checkout session renders correctly in browser
- Webhook events captured and verified successfully
- Signature validation logs: ✅ verified, ⛔ invalid cases flagged
- No unhandled exceptions in webhook processing
- Webhook processing latency: ≤500ms

**Deliverables:**
- Code in `spike/stripe-poc` branch
- Screenshots of checkout flow
- Webhook processing logs with signature validation
- Status: "WEBHOOKS SECURE" or "NEEDS MORE WORK"

**Risk Mitigation**: If webhook security fails, implement additional validation layers

## Spike 3: FCM Push Notification Delivery

**Objective**: Validate push notification registration and delivery on real device

**Tasks:**
1. Register FCM project (or reuse existing)
2. Build basic Flutter token registration screen
3. Capture and log device push token
4. Send manual push notification from backend
5. Measure delivery time and reliability

**Success Criteria:**
- Device token registration successful
- Push notification delivered in ≤3s
- Notification content renders correctly on device
- No crashes or silent failures
- Token refresh handling works

**Deliverables:**
- Video/screenshots of device notification
- Push delivery logs with timestamps
- Token registration flow documentation
- Entry in validation checklist

**Risk Mitigation**: If FCM fails, evaluate alternative push providers

## Integration Points & Dependencies

**Fastify ↔ Supabase**: JWT validation with Supabase Auth
**Stripe ↔ Fastify**: Webhook processing and session management  
**FCM ↔ Flutter**: Token management and notification handling

## Timeline & Resource Allocation

**Week 1**: 
- Spike 1 & 2 (parallel execution)
- Fastify server + Stripe integration

**Week 2**:
- Spike 3 (FCM validation)
- Integration testing and documentation
- Final validation report

## Success Metrics & Evidence

**Performance Validation:**
- Fastify p95 ≤200ms under 100 concurrent users
- Stripe webhook processing ≤500ms
- FCM delivery ≤3s on real device

**Security Validation:**
- Stripe webhook signature verification 100% reliable
- JWT validation working with Supabase Auth
- FCM token management secure

**Operational Validation:**
- All services boot reliably
- Error handling works as expected
- Logging and monitoring functional

## Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK**: Fastify performance failure would require architecture change
**MEDIUM RISK**: Stripe webhook issues could delay payment features
**LOW RISK**: FCM issues have alternative notification strategies

## Next Steps After Validation

**If All Spikes VALIDATED:**
- Proceed to Phase 2 (Production Infrastructure Setup)
- Update aiconfig.json with validated integration patterns
- Begin MVP development with confidence

**If Any Spike FAILS:**
- Implement mitigation strategy for failed component
- Re-evaluate affected ADRs and timeline
- Consider alternative solutions before proceeding
