# Discovery Flow Specification

**Status**: 🔴 **Specification Required**  
**Created**: 2025-06-24  
**Plan Task**: t011 (IMPLEMENTATION)  
**Test Task**: t010 (TEST_CREATION - must create failing tests first)  
**User Flow Reference**: From MVP Feature Set

---

## Overview

The Discovery Flow represents the complete user journey for finding and exploring recipes in WorldChef. This specification defines every interaction, decision point, transition, and error path in the discovery process.

## ⚠️ Current Status: SPECIFICATION REQUIRED

**This document is a placeholder that defines the required structure.**

**Before implementation, the following must be completed:**
1. **Task t010**: Create failing validation tests for discovery flow
2. **Screen Specifications**: Complete all screen specifications (tasks t004-t006)
3. **Component Library**: Define all required components (tasks t007-t009)
4. **User Research**: Validate flow assumptions with stakeholder input

## Flow Overview (From MVP Feature Set)

**Primary Flow**: Home feed → Search input → Filter application → Recipe detail → Like/favorite

### Entry Points
1. **App Launch**: Direct to Home Feed (after onboarding)
2. **Deep Link**: Direct to specific recipe or search results
3. **Push Notification**: Direct to featured recipe or category
4. **Tab Navigation**: From other app sections

### Exit Points
1. **Recipe Detail Engagement**: Like, favorite, share, or purchase
2. **Recipe Creation**: Navigate to creation flow
3. **Profile Management**: Navigate to profile section
4. **App Background**: Pause discovery session

## Detailed Flow Specification (To Be Implemented)

### 1. Home Feed Discovery

#### Initial State
```
User arrives at Home Feed screen
├── Loading State: Display skeleton cards while fetching
├── Success State: Display paginated recipe list
└── Error State: Show error with retry option
```

#### User Actions & Decision Points
1. **Browse Recipe Cards**
   - **Action**: Scroll through recipe list
   - **System Response**: Load more recipes as user approaches bottom
   - **Performance**: Maintain ≥58 FPS during scroll
   - **Decision Point**: User sees interesting recipe

2. **Apply Filters**
   - **Action**: Tap filter chip (cuisine, dietary)
   - **System Response**: Update recipe list with filtered results
   - **Animation**: Smooth transition with loading state
   - **Decision Point**: Results match user intent or need refinement

3. **Search Recipes**
   - **Action**: Tap search icon or search bar
   - **System Response**: Expand search interface
   - **Navigation**: Stay on Home Feed or navigate to Search screen (TBD)
   - **Decision Point**: User has specific recipe in mind

### 2. Recipe Detail Exploration

#### Navigation Trigger
- **From**: Recipe card tap on Home Feed
- **Transition**: Hero animation from card image to detail image
- **Loading**: Progressive loading of recipe details

#### User Actions & Decision Points
1. **Recipe Evaluation**
   - **Action**: Read recipe details, ingredients, instructions
   - **System Response**: Display complete recipe information
   - **Decision Points**: 
     - Recipe appeals to user → Like/favorite action
     - Recipe requires purchase → Navigate to checkout
     - Recipe inspires creation → Navigate to creation flow
     - Recipe not interesting → Navigate back

2. **Engagement Actions**
   - **Like Recipe**: Optimistic update with server sync
   - **Favorite Recipe**: Add to personal collection
   - **Share Recipe**: Native sharing interface
   - **View Creator**: Navigate to creator profile

### 3. Search & Filter Refinement

#### Search Flow
```
Search Initiation
├── Expand search bar on Home Feed
├── Enter search query
├── Display search suggestions (optional)
├── Execute search
├── Display results with filters
└── Refine or select result
```

#### Filter Flow
```
Filter Application
├── Select filter category (cuisine, dietary, etc.)
├── Choose specific filter values
├── Apply filters to current view
├── Display filtered results
└── Clear filters or refine further
```

### 4. Error & Edge Cases

#### Network Connectivity Issues
1. **Offline State**: Display cached content with offline indicator
2. **Poor Connection**: Show loading states with timeout handling
3. **Server Error**: Display error message with retry functionality

#### Empty States
1. **No Search Results**: Search-specific empty state with suggestions
2. **No Filtered Results**: Filter-specific empty state with option to clear
3. **No Cached Content**: Offline empty state with explanation

#### User Abandonment Points
1. **Long Loading Times**: Provide feedback and cancel options
2. **Complex Filters**: Offer simplified filter options
3. **Overwhelming Results**: Provide sorting and refinement options

## Interaction Specifications (To Be Implemented)

### Animation & Transition Requirements
- **Screen Transitions**: Material Design navigation patterns
- **Filter Application**: Smooth list updates with fade transitions
- **Search Execution**: Progressive disclosure of results
- **Loading States**: Skeleton animations or progress indicators

### Performance Requirements
- **Search Response Time**: <500ms for query execution
- **Filter Application**: <200ms for filter response
- **Image Loading**: Progressive loading with placeholders
- **Scroll Performance**: Maintain ≥58 FPS throughout flow

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Screen Reader**: Announce all state changes and navigation
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order throughout flow
- **Voice Control**: Support for voice-activated search
- **High Contrast**: Ensure visibility in accessibility modes

## Analytics & Tracking Points (To Be Implemented)

### User Journey Metrics
1. **Flow Entry**: Track entry point and user context
2. **Search Behavior**: Query patterns and refinement frequency
3. **Filter Usage**: Most popular filters and combinations
4. **Recipe Engagement**: View time, likes, favorites per session
5. **Conversion Points**: Recipe detail views to engagement actions
6. **Abandonment Points**: Where users exit the flow

### Performance Metrics
1. **Load Times**: Time to display initial content
2. **Search Performance**: Query response times
3. **Scroll Performance**: Frame rate during list interactions
4. **Error Rates**: Network failures and recovery success

## Implementation Dependencies

### Required Screens
- Home Feed Screen (with search and filter capabilities)
- Recipe Detail Screen (with engagement actions)
- Search Screen (if separate from Home Feed - TBD)

### Required Components
- RecipeCard (with all interaction states)
- SearchBar (expandable with suggestions)
- FilterChips (multi-select with clear options)
- LoadingIndicators (for various states)
- ErrorStates (with retry functionality)
- EmptyStates (context-specific)

### Required State Management
- RecipeListProvider (with pagination and filtering)
- SearchProvider (with query management)
- FilterProvider (with state persistence)
- OfflineProvider (with connectivity monitoring)
