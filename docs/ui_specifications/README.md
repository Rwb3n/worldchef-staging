## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive UI specifications that eliminate all implicitness in the WorldChef mobile application design. Every screen, component, interaction, and design decision is explicitly documented following Atomic Design Principles.

**A live, interactive version of these specifications is implemented in Widgetbook.** This serves as the single source of truth for component and screen implementations.

## Specification Standards

### Documentation Requirements
- **Visual Mockups**: Every specification must include visual representations
- **Interaction Descriptions**: All user interactions explicitly documented
- **Accessibility Requirements**: WCAG AA compliance specifications
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical implementation guidance
- **State Definitions**: All component and screen states defined
- **Error Handling**: Error states and recovery patterns specified

### Design Token Management
- All design decisions captured as design tokens
- Explicit naming conventions and usage guidelines
- Material Design 3 integration specifications
- Dark/light theme support requirements

### Component Specification Format
- API specifications with all props and variants
- Visual examples for all states
- Accessibility requirements and implementations
- Usage guidelines and best practices
- Performance requirements and optimizations

## Key Principles

1. **Atomic Design**: Components organized as Atoms â†’ Molecules â†’ Organisms â†’ Templates â†’ Pages
2. **Material Design 3**: Base design system with WorldChef customizations
3. **Accessibility First**: WCAG AA compliance for all components
4. **Performance Driven**: All specifications include performance requirements
5. **Internationalization Ready**: RTL support and string externalization
6. **Test-Driven**: Every specification includes validation tests and has a corresponding interactive story in Widgetbook.

## Status Tracking

| Category | Status | Completion | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Design System | âœ… Implemented | 100% | All core tokens (colors, typography, spacing, animations) are defined and implemented in `AppTheme` and demonstrated in Widgetbook. |
| Screen Specifications | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 50% | `Home Feed` and `Recipe Detail` screens have been specified and implemented in Widgetbook. Other screens are pending. |
| Component Library | âœ… Implemented | 95% | All major atoms, molecules, and organisms are specified and implemented in Widgetbook. Minor gaps may exist. |
| User Flows | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 20% | Core flows like Discovery and Onboarding are defined. |
| Validation Tests | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 30% | Manual validation via Widgetbook is complete. Automated validation framework is now being built. |
