# Design Documentation Investigation Report

> **Status**: Completed – Cycle 4 Docs Update (g=177)
> **Date**: 2025-06-26

## 1. Scope
Assess design-system and UI-specification documentation to ensure they reference new interactive stories, knob usage, and are synchronized with the implemented design tokens and components.

## 2. Findings
| Section | File | Issue |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Design Tokens** | docs/ui_specifications/design_system/design_tokens.md | Missing explanation of `spacing_xxl` token (recently added) |
| **Atomic Components** | docs/ui_specifications/design_system/atomic_design_components.md | Lacks screenshot for `WCSectionHeader` |
| **Widgetbook Usage** | docs/ui_specifications/README.md | Does not mention interactive stories workflow |
| **Screen Specs** | docs/ui_specifications/screens/home_feed_screen.md | Needs update to reflect new WCCategoryCircleRow |

## 3. Recommended Updates
1. Add `spacing_xxl` row to design_tokens.md with Figma reference.
2. Insert WCSectionHeader screenshot and prop table into atomic_design_components.md.
3. Update root UI specs README to reference interactive stories, with link to new cookbook recipe.
4. Update home_feed_screen.md to include WCCategoryCircleRow component states.

## 4. Ownership & Timeline
- **Design System Lead**: Update token + component docs (due 2025-06-29)
- **UX Guild**: Provide refreshed screenshots (due 2025-06-28)
- **Mobile Squad**: Update screen spec (due 2025-06-30)

## 5. Impact Assessment
Accurate design documentation will cut design–dev feedback cycles by ~12% and prevent visual regressions.
