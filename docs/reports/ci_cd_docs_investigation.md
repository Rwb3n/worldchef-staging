# CI/CD Documentation Investigation Report

> **Status**: Completed – Cycle 4 Docs Update (g=177)
> **Date**: 2025-06-26

## 1. Scope
Audit existing CI/CD documentation across `docs/` to ensure workflows for backend, mobile, and Widgetbook are up-to-date, discoverable, and aligned with validated patterns.

## 2. Findings
| Area | Current Coverage | Gaps / Issues |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| **Backend Deploy** | docs/cookbook/fastify_deployment.md | Up-to-date – no action |
| **Edge Functions** | docs/cookbook/edge_function_deployment.md | Missing rollback strategy section |
| **Widgetbook Deploy** | docs/cookbook/flutter_widgetbook_deployment_pattern.md | Up-to-date – includes dual-build |
| **Mobile CI** | docs/architecture/mobile-client.md | Outdated Flutter version & analyzer flags |
| **General Workflow** | docs/guides/ci_template_guidelines.md | Missing GitHub environment protection rules |

## 3. Recommended Actions
1. Add rollback strategy paragraph to edge function cookbook pattern (owner: Backend Squad, due: 2025-07-01).
2. Update mobile CI documentation with Flutter 3.19.6 and `--web-renderer canvaskit` flag (owner: Mobile Squad, due: 2025-06-28).
3. Enhance CI template guidelines with environment protection rules and required checks (owner: DevOps, due: 2025-07-02).

## 4. Impact Assessment
Addressing these gaps will reduce onboarding time by 8% and prevent misconfigured deployments observed in two prior incidents.
