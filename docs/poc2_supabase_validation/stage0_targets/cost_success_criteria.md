## **🎯 Primary Cost Thresholds**

### **Critical Decision Point: 10k MAU**
Per ADR-WCF-001d mandate, 10k MAU cost projection determines PoC success/failure:

- **TARGET**: ≤ **$75/month** (ADR budget constraint)
- **ACCEPTABLE**: ≤ **$100/month** (33% buffer for growth)
- **FAILURE THRESHOLD**: > **$150/month** (triggers alternative evaluation)

### **Growth Milestone Thresholds**

#### **1k MAU (Early MVP)**
- **TARGET**: **Free Tier** preferred ($0/month)
- **ACCEPTABLE**: < **$10/month** (minimal infrastructure cost)
- **FAILURE**: > **$25/month** (unsustainable for early stage)

#### **5k MAU (Growth Phase)**
- **TARGET**: < **$25/month** (sustainable growth)
- **ACCEPTABLE**: < **$40/month** (60% buffer)
- **FAILURE**: > **$75/month** (exceeds 10k MAU budget)

## **⚠️ Cost Risk Factors**

### **Pricing Volatility Risks**
1. **Supabase Pricing Changes**: Platform is growing, pricing may evolve
2. **AWS Underlying Costs**: Supabase built on AWS, subject to their pricing
3. **Feature Expansion**: New Supabase features may alter cost structure
4. **Usage Pattern Evolution**: Actual usage may differ from projections

### **Usage Amplification Risks**
1. **Viral Content Effects**: Popular recipes could drive 3-5x normal traffic
2. **Seasonal Peaks**: Holiday cooking could drive sustained high usage
3. **Creator Onboarding**: Influencer partnerships could shift user distribution
4. **Feature Adoption**: Higher than expected nutrition enrichment usage

### **Technical Overhead Risks**
1. **RLS Performance Impact**: May require higher compute tier
2. **Query Optimization Needs**: Unoptimized queries could increase costs
3. **Edge Function Complexity**: Heavier functions could exceed CPU estimates
4. **Storage Growth**: User-generated content could grow faster than modeled

## **🛡️ Cost Mitigation Strategies**

### **Tier Management Strategy**
- **Start Free Tier**: Validate basic functionality and initial costs
- **Upgrade to Pro**: Only when Free tier limits reached (likely Stage 3)
- **Monitor Usage**: Daily cost tracking during testing periods
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to downgrade if costs exceed thresholds

### **Usage Optimization**
- **Query Efficiency**: Optimize queries before load testing
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement PostgREST caching where appropriate
- **Resource Right-sizing**: Monitor and adjust edge function memory
- **Data Lifecycle**: Implement data archiving for cost management

### **Contingency Planning**
- **Cost Overrun Response**: Document optimization attempts before escalation
- **Alternative Evaluation**: Trigger disaggregated stack PoC if costs fail
- **Hybrid Approach**: Consider Supabase for specific services only

## **📈 Cost Monitoring Framework**

### **Real-time Cost Tracking**
- **Daily Monitoring**: Supabase billing dashboard during PoC
- **Service Breakdown**: Track individual service costs (DB, Auth, Edge, Storage)
- **Usage Correlation**: Map usage patterns to cost spikes
- **Projection Updates**: Refine 10k MAU projections with real data

### **Cost Evaluation Stages**

#### **Stage 1-2: Initial Setup & Schema**
- **Expected**: Free tier sufficient for development
- **Monitor**: Database operations, storage growth
- **Alert Threshold**: >$5/month before data seeding

#### **Stage 3: Data Seeding**
- **Expected**: Potential Pro tier upgrade needed
- **Monitor**: Storage costs, backup overhead
- **Alert Threshold**: >$20/month for 100k records

#### **Stage 4: Load Testing**
- **Expected**: Higher compute usage during testing
- **Monitor**: Concurrent connection costs, CPU spikes
- **Alert Threshold**: Extrapolated costs >$120/month at 10k MAU

#### **Stage 5: Cost Analysis**
- **Final Evaluation**: Comprehensive cost model validation
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: ±50% usage variance scenarios
- **Decision Point**: Clear pass/fail determination

## **✅ Success/Failure Decision Matrix**

### **SUCCESS Criteria (All Must Pass)**
- 10k MAU projected cost ≤ $100/month with 20% buffer
- 5k MAU cost < $40/month for sustainable growth path
- 1k MAU remains on/near Free tier (<$10/month)
- Cost transparency: Clear understanding of all service components
- Scalability confidence: Linear cost scaling with usage growth

### **FAILURE Triggers (Any One Fails PoC)**
- 10k MAU projected cost > $150/month
- Inability to accurately project costs due to pricing complexity
- Significant cost volatility risk (>50% month-to-month variation)
- Required Pro tier features create unsustainable early-stage costs
- Hidden or unexpected cost components discovered

### **CONDITIONAL Success (Require Mitigation)**
- 10k MAU cost $100-150/month (evaluate optimization potential)
- High sensitivity to usage spikes (>2x cost impact)
- Service-specific cost concentration (>50% in single service)
- Free tier limitations require premature Pro upgrade

## **🔄 Alternative Evaluation Trigger**

If PoC #2 fails cost criteria, initiate **Disaggregated Stack PoC**:
- **Self-hosted PostgreSQL** on AWS/Digital Ocean
- **Separate Authentication Service** (Auth0, Firebase Auth)
- **Custom API Layer** (Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI)
- **Edge Function Alternative** (AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions)

**Cost Comparison Required**: Total disaggregated cost vs Supabase at 10k MAU
