## Executive Summary

This document defines the **single authoritative strategy** for coordinating UI Planning (`plan_ui_comprehensive_planning.txt`) and Mobile MVP (`plan_cycle4_mobile_mvp.txt`) execution to eliminate all UI implicitness while maintaining Cycle 4 delivery timeline.

**Selected Approach**: **Modified UI-First with Phased Delivery**

## üéØ **Integration Strategy Overview**

### **Core Principle**: Zero Implicitness Through Phased Dependencies

The UI Planning tasks have been **restructured with MVP-priority phases** to provide explicit specifications exactly when MVP implementation needs them, eliminating all implicit design decisions.

### **Timeline Coordination**
```
Days 1-4:  UI Foundation & Screen Specs (MVP Blockers)
Days 5-10: MVP Implementation (Using Explicit Specs)
Days 11-14: UI Completion & MVP Polish (Parallel)
```

## üìã **Phased Execution Plan**

### **Phase 1: UI Foundation (Days 1-3) - MVP CRITICAL**

**Objective**: Provide minimum viable UI specifications to unblock MVP development

**UI Tasks (MVP Priority: CRITICAL)**:
- **t001**: Design System Validation Tests (Red)
- **t002**: MVP-Critical Design System Foundation (Green)
  - Timeline: Maximum 2 days
  - Scope: Primary colors, core typography, basic spacing, essential components only
  - Uses Material Design 3 defaults for non-critical decisions

**Success Criteria**: 
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Widgetbook CI/CD pipeline operational (t001)
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Design system validation tests created (t001)
- üü° **NEXT**: MVP-critical design tokens implementation (t002)
- üü° **PENDING**: Essential component specifications (t002)
- üü° **BLOCKED**: MVP development start (waiting for t002)

### **Phase 2: Screen Specifications (Days 2-4) - MVP CRITICAL**

**Objective**: Provide explicit screen layouts and interactions for MVP screens

**UI Tasks (MVP Priority: CRITICAL)**:
- **t004**: MVP Screen Validation Tests (Red) 
  - Scope: Home Feed and Recipe Detail screens only
  - Timeline: Maximum 1 day
- **t005**: MVP Screen Specifications (Green)
  - Scope: Essential layouts and interactions only
  - Timeline: Maximum 2 days

**Execution**: **Parallel with Phase 1** (Days 2-4)

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Home Feed screen wireframes and specifications complete
- ‚úÖ Recipe Detail screen wireframes and specifications complete
- ‚úÖ MVP screens can be implemented with explicit layout specifications

### **Phase 3: MVP Implementation (Days 5-10) - USING EXPLICIT SPECS**

**Objective**: Implement MVP features using Phase 1&2 specifications

**MVP Tasks (All depend on UI Phase 1&2 completion)**:
- **t001-t003**: Home Feed implementation sequence (TDD)
- **t004-t006**: Recipe Detail implementation sequence (TDD)
- **t007-t009**: Checkout implementation sequence (TDD)

**Critical Dependencies**:
- **MVP CANNOT START** until UI t002 and t005 are COMPLETED
- All MVP tasks use explicit design tokens from UI t002
- All MVP screens use explicit layouts from UI t005

### **Phase 4: UI Completion & MVP Polish (Days 11-14) - PARALLEL**

**Objective**: Complete comprehensive UI system while polishing MVP

**UI Tasks (MVP Priority: ENHANCEMENT)**:
- **t003**: Design System Completion (Refactor)
- **t006**: Screen Specification Optimization (Refactor)
- **t007-t012**: Component Library & Advanced Features

**MVP Tasks**:
- Integration testing and performance optimization
- Bug fixes and polish based on testing results

**Execution**: **Parallel execution** - UI completion doesn't block MVP delivery

## üîó **Dependency Management**

### **Critical Path Dependencies**

1. **UI t002 ‚Üí ALL MVP Tasks**
   - MVP cannot start without design system foundation
   - Provides essential design tokens and component specifications

2. **UI t005 ‚Üí MVP Screen Tasks**
   - MVP screen implementation requires explicit layout specifications
   - Provides wireframes and interaction patterns

3. **MVP t001-t009 ‚Üí UI Phase 4**
   - UI completion tasks can reference actual implementation
   - Allows optimization based on real usage patterns

### **Parallel Execution Opportunities**

- **Days 2-4**: UI t004/t005 (Screen Specs) ‚Üî UI t001/t002 (Design System)
- **Days 5-10**: MVP Implementation ‚Üî UI Environment Setup
- **Days 11-14**: UI Completion ‚Üî MVP Polish & Testing

## üìä **Risk Management**

### **Timeline Risks**

**Risk**: UI Phase 1&2 delays block MVP start
- **Mitigation**: Maximum 4-day timeline with explicit scope limitations. **Visual validation tooling (Widgetbook CI/CD) is now implemented, reducing risk of rework.**
- **Fallback**: Use Material Design 3 defaults for delayed decisions
- **Escalation**: If UI tasks exceed 4 days, proceed with MVP using Material Design 3 defaults

### **Quality Risks**

**Risk**: Rushed UI specs lead to implementation rework
- **Mitigation**: Focus on MVP-critical screens and components only in Phase 1&2
- **Validation**: All UI tasks include validation tests (Red step). **Widgetbook deployment pipeline now provides automated visual validation builds for PRs.**
- **Fallback**: Iterative refinement in Phase 4

**Risk**: MVP implementation diverges from UI specifications
- **Mitigation**: Explicit dependency enforcement in plan structure
- **Validation**: MVP golden tests must match UI specifications. **Live Widgetbook deployment will serve as the visual source of truth.**
- **Monitoring**: Daily coordination during MVP implementation phase

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

### **Phase 1&2 Completion Criteria**
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Design system validation tests failing appropriately (Red step confirmed via Widgetbook scaffolding)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Widgetbook CI/CD pipeline operational with green build status
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS**: MVP-critical design tokens documented and validated (t002 ready to start)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Home Feed and Recipe Detail screen specifications complete (t005)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: All UI specifications have corresponding validation tests
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: MVP development team has explicit specifications for all implementation tasks

### **Phase 3 Completion Criteria**
- [ ] All MVP tasks implemented using explicit UI specifications
- [ ] No implicit design decisions made during MVP implementation
- [ ] MVP golden tests pass using UI specifications
- [ ] Performance targets met using specified design system

### **Phase 4 Completion Criteria**
- [ ] Complete UI system ready for post-MVP development
- [ ] MVP polish completed without breaking UI compliance
- [ ] Zero rework required due to missing specifications
- [ ] Full integration testing complete

## üìù **Execution Protocol**

### **Phase Handoff Requirements**

**Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2**: Design system foundation complete
- UI t002 status = COMPLETED
- Design tokens available for screen specifications

**Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3**: Screen specifications complete  
- UI t005 status = COMPLETED
- MVP can start with explicit layout specifications

**Phase 3 ‚Üí Phase 4**: MVP implementation in progress
- MVP t001-t006 in progress or completed
- UI completion can proceed in parallel

### **Daily Coordination During Phase 1&2**
1. **Design System Updates**: Immediately available to screen specification tasks
2. **Screen Specification Updates**: Immediately available to MVP planning
3. **Blocker Escalation**: Any UI task exceeding timeline triggers fallback protocol

### **Quality Gates**

- **Day 4**: Screen specifications for MVP screens complete  
- **Day 5**: MVP implementation starts with explicit specifications
- **Day 10**: MVP core functionality complete
