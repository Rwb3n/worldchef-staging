# Provisioning vs. Deployment Clarification
## Cycle 4 Week 0 - Infrastructure Focus

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2025-06-13T16:45:00Z  
**Global Event:** g91  

## Key Distinction

### **Week 0: PROVISIONING (Infrastructure Foundation)**
Setting up the **environment** where applications will eventually run.

#### What We're Building:
1. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Kubernetes cluster or container hosting platform
   - ✅ Networking (VPC, subnets, security groups)
   - ✅ Load balancers and ingress controllers
   - ✅ Domain configuration (staging.worldchef.example.com)
   - ✅ TLS certificate management

2. **Database Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Supabase staging project creation
   - ✅ Database schema deployment (tables, indexes, RLS)
   - ✅ Connection pooling configuration
   - ✅ Backup and monitoring setup

3. **CI/CD Infrastructure**
   - ✅ GitHub Actions workflows configured
   - ✅ Container registry setup
   - ✅ Deployment automation pipelines
   - ✅ Security scanning integration

4. **Monitoring Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Monitoring stack provisioned (Prometheus, Grafana)
   - ✅ Log aggregation system
   - ✅ Alerting channels (Slack integration)

5. **Data Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Synthetic data generation scripts
   - ✅ Automated refresh system
   - ✅ S3 buckets for image storage

#### What We're NOT Doing (That's Deployment):
- ❌ Running live Fastify servers with application code
- ❌ Serving actual API requests
- ❌ Mobile apps connecting to staging
- ❌ End-to-end user flows
- ❌ Performance testing with real traffic

### **Weeks 1-3: DEPLOYMENT (Application Execution)**
Taking application code and running it on the provisioned infrastructure.

#### What Happens During Deployment:
- 🚀 Fastify servers start serving requests
- 🚀 API endpoints become accessible
- 🚀 Mobile apps connect to staging APIs
- 🚀 Real user authentication flows
- 🚀 Live payment processing (test mode)
- 🚀 Push notifications to devices

## Week 0 Deliverables (Provisioning Only)

### Infrastructure Ready State:
```bash
# These should work after Week 0 provisioning:
kubectl get nodes                    # ✅ Cluster ready
kubectl get namespaces              # ✅ staging namespace exists
dig staging.worldchef.example.com   # ✅ DNS resolves
curl -k https://staging.worldchef.example.com  # ✅ TLS cert (but no app yet)

# These will NOT work until deployment (Weeks 1-3):
curl https://staging.worldchef.example.com/health     # ❌ No app running
curl https://staging.worldchef.example.com/v1/recipes # ❌ No API yet
```

### Database Ready State:
```sql
-- These should work after Week 0 provisioning:
\dt                                  -- ✅ Tables exist
SELECT * FROM pg_policies;           -- ✅ RLS policies active
SELECT count(*) FROM users;          -- ✅ Synthetic data loaded

-- These will work during deployment:
-- API calls that query the database through application code
```

### CI/CD Ready State:
```yaml
# These should be configured after Week 0:
# ✅ .github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml exists
# ✅ GitHub secrets configured
# ✅ Pipeline can build containers
# ✅ Pipeline can deploy to staging

# These will happen during deployment:
# 🚀 Actual application deployment triggered
# 🚀 Live health checks passing
# 🚀 Real API endpoints responding
```

## Success Criteria for Week 0 (Corrected)

### Infrastructure Provisioning Complete When:
- [ ] Cloud infrastructure provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Domain configured with valid TLS certificates
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster ready for application deployment
- [ ] Supabase project created with schema deployed
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured and tested (without live deployment)
- [ ] Monitoring infrastructure provisioned
- [ ] Synthetic data generation scripts created and tested
- [ ] Secrets management system configured
- [ ] Security scanning tools integrated

### Ready for Week 1 Deployment When:
- [ ] Infrastructure can accept application deployments
- [ ] Database can handle application connections
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline can deploy applications
- [ ] Monitoring can track application metrics
- [ ] Data refresh can maintain test data

## Analogy: Building vs. Moving In

**Week 0 Provisioning** = Building the house
- Foundation, walls, plumbing, electrical
- House is structurally complete
- But no one lives there yet

**Weeks 1-3 Deployment** = Moving in and living
- Furniture, appliances, daily activities
- People actually using the house
- House serves its intended purpose

## Next Steps After Week 0

1. **Week 1 Validation Track**
   - Deploy minimal Fastify application to test infrastructure
   - Validate Stripe integration on live staging
   - Test FCM push notifications end-to-end

2. **Weeks 1-3 Backend Development**
   - Deploy MVP API endpoints to staging infrastructure
   - Connect mobile applications to staging APIs
   - Execute full user flows on provisioned environment

---

**Key Takeaway:** Week 0 builds the foundation. Weeks 1-3 bring it to life with actual applications and user flows.
