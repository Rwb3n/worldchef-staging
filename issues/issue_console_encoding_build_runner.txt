  "description": "PowerShell PSReadLine component fails to handle Unicode characters (specifically emoji sequences starting with \\uD83D) when executing Flutter build_runner, causing System.Text.EncoderFallbackException and preventing reliable execution/observation of 'flutter pub run build_runner build' command during PoC development.",

  "resolution_summary": "Implemented manual JSON serialization as functionally equivalent workaround. Created recipe_manual.dart with hand-written fromJson/toJson methods matching json_serializable generated code. This enables PoC development to continue without being blocked by environment-specific console issues. Manual implementation provides identical functionality and allows seamless progression to UI development tasks.",

This originates from Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine specifically within WriteHistoryRange and MaybeAddToHistory methods when handling Flutter command output containing emoji sequences."
